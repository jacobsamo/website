## What i have learnt from my startup
Photo by Mika Baumeister on UnsplashOver the past 2 years on and off I have been building my start up Mixie cooking, over that time it has seen 2 rewrites, hundards of hours spent writing code, reading docs and debugging bugs.
Throughout the project I have learnt so much not only about software development but everything from marketing to design to the development cycle and much more.
What have I learnt?
**1. Software development is not easy**
Building software is really a love, hate relationship. a lot of patience and time spent on what is trival. you might spend hours trying to figure out such a small thing and when you look back and say you spend 10 hours building that it can be demorilising at times but at the end of the day you build a product you are proud of.
**2. You'll constantly doubt if your idea is good enough**
When you start you think your idea is awesome that it will be better then all the rest, however as you go further into development you start to doubt if it is, especially if you look at other products that are better (because that are more mature) then your little startup.
Somewhere along this line you keep pushing, trying and trying to prove yourself right which means you have to put the hard yards to bring your idea to life proving yourself right all along.
P.s I am not there yet
**3. Build a product for you and your loved ones**
The best startups are ones that solve a problem for themselves, something either themselves or their loved ones is missing in their life, because you are the customer, you know the problem and how to solve it.
This is why I built Mixie because I found it hard to find delious recipes and share my own with my family.
**4. Marketing and sharing as you go**
There is no surprise that if you don't get the word out no one will know, this is even more true with your startup, you get consumed by the building that you forget to share your application with your community to get them on board, to hear their ideas.
It is not easy marketing is often the boring side of the startup however it is what gets users / customers to your product in the end.
**5. Building with an other will keep you motivated**
Now this I think is something easy to miss but developing with an other person is so powerful you get shared ideas, get to split the load. the key here is finding someone that fills that parts that your not strong at.
This is something that I missed in Mixie which I now realise was quite a downfall but for now it will have to do.

## Ending
As I keep working through Mixie I will learn even more, fail over and over again and hopefully during that journey I will build a community that wants to join along for the ride and possible try out the products I build.
So if you would like to connect or even try out my start up Mixie please have a look at the links it would mean the world to me.
