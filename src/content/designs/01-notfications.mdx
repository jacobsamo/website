## Breakdown
This animartion is a recreated from a tweet I saw from [Jakub Antalik](https://x.com/Jakubantalik)

Taking in the animation values in video I was able to recreate the animaimated notification component, while also extending it for when the notifcation count increases.

There wasn't alot going into this peices however it was a nice starting point for learning journery 

### Learnings
In [Motion](https://motion.dev) your can define custom [transition](https://motion.dev/docs/react-transitions) values for each animated property. This give you fined grained controls and let's you build more complex animations without relying on a shared transition value. 

For example in this notion animations we're animating multiple values (`x`, `scale` and `opacity`) and each one needs slightly different transition values to feel right. Instead of applying a blanket transition value to all properties, we can define custom transitions for each property. we can specify them individually:
```ts
transition: {
	default: { duration: 0.3 },
	x: { duration: 0.3 },
	opacity: { duration: 0.3, ease: [0.2, 0, 0, 1] },
	scale: {
		duration: 0.35, // total: 150ms + 200ms = 350ms
		times: [0, 0.43, 1], // 0.15/0.35 = 0.43 (scale to 1.05 at 43% of timeline)
		ease: [0.2, 0, 0, 1],
	},
},
```
This apporach let's each property animate on it's own timeline, producing a more natural and fluid animation.
