## Breakdown
This animation is recreated from a tweet I saw from [Jakub Antalik](https://x.com/Jakubantalik)
<TweetCard id="2000581109755920500" />
Taking in the animation values in the video I was able to recreate the animated notification component, while also extending it for when the notification count increases.

There wasn't a lot going into this piece however it was a nice starting point for my learning journey.

### Learnings
In [Motion](https://motion.dev) you can define custom [transition](https://motion.dev/docs/react-transitions) values for each animated property. This gives you fine-grained control and lets you build more complex animations without relying on a shared transition value.

For example in this notification animation we're animating multiple values (`x`, `scale` and `opacity`) and each one needs slightly different transition values to feel right. Instead of applying a blanket transition value to all properties, we can define custom transitions for each property. We can specify them individually:
```ts
transition: {
	default: { duration: 0.3 },
	x: { duration: 0.3 },
	opacity: { duration: 0.3, ease: [0.2, 0, 0, 1] },
	scale: {
		duration: 0.35, // total: 150ms + 200ms = 350ms
		times: [0, 0.43, 1], // 0.15/0.35 = 0.43 (scale to 1.05 at 43% of timeline)
		ease: [0.2, 0, 0, 1],
	},
},
```
This approach lets each property animate on its own timeline, producing a more natural and fluid animation.
